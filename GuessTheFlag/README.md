# GuessTheFlag

GuessTheFlag app covers [day 20,21, and 22](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/20) of 100 days of SwiftUI. The purpose of this project is to learn more about the colors and gradients while applying them to a simple game. While learning how to use colors, I added alerts and simple animations to the game.
