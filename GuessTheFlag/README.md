# GuessTheFlag

As part of [100 days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) I followed the instructions and implemented truely simple game where user 
can guess the flag. This learning project specifically represents [day 20-21-22](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/2). Again, this is a 
one small step for mankind, one giant leap for me.
