## RockPaperScissor

RockPaperScissor app covers [day 25 challange](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/25) of 100 days of SwiftUI. The purpose of this project is to combine all the information I learned in the previous days in an app that I implemented without following any instructions. It is a simple game where user has to do the correct move against an advanced AI(just a random function ðŸ˜„)
