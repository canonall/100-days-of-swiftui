# UnitConverterIOS

As part of [100 days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) I created a genuinely basic UnitConverter app to apply my initial learnings of 
SwiftUI. This project specifically represents [day 19 challange](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/19). This is a 
one small step for mankind, one giant leap for me.
