## ViewsAndModifiers

ViewsAndModifiers app covers [day 23 and 24](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/23) of 100 days of SwiftUI. The purpose of this project is to understand how modifiers works, how to create custom or conditional modifiers, how modififer order affects the view. So that, I can get conformable with them.
