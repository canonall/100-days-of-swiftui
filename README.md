# 100 Days of SwiftUI

The best way of learning is to get your hands dirty and write some code, right? With that mentality, I started [100 days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) in order to apply and enhance my knowledge in Swift and gain fundamental knowledge in SwiftUI. From the table below you can reach all the projects covered in this course in chronological order. In order words, starting from the first project to the last project you can observe my progress. First apps are quite small and basic, whereas through the end of the course projects get bigger and more comprehensive. With that being said, **_challenge_ projects cover all previously practiced topics. Thus, they are more broad and meaningful to check over.** Please keep in my that none of these projects are meant to look fancy and shiny. Therefore, they have a simple UI. Apart from that, the purpose of _technical_ projects is sometimes to understand how components work and sometimes to discover the capabilities of a component. Thus, they are small and don't serve a meaning purpose from an app perspective.

The _Project Overview_ column links to project details on the course page, while the _Project_ column links to the code. I tried to summarize the covered topics in the _Main Subjects_ column, but of course, there is more in the projects ðŸ˜‰

Lastly, I would like to thank [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws) and his lovely Samoyeds for this course.
